# Abstract
Social media is used intensively by every segment and people share their real ideas, emotions and opinions through these environments without cencorship. Researches have begun to be conducted over this area with the increaing use of socail media. In particuar, Twitter is one of the most important data sources for human anaylsis and research. The agenda topic and the most talked issues are interpreted especially on Twitter. Owing to this situation, Twitter is used as a source for data in this project. Natural language processing techiniques are used for classifying emotions and extracting the emotion from texts with the technique called ‘Sentiment Analysis’.In this study, sentiment analysis is used to evaluate tweets. The aim is to determine wheter the data is positive or negative. In this study, sentiment anaylsis will be performed using Deep Learning algorithm that is LSTM. The result of algortihms is compared according to use different tweets. In this investigation, corona in ABD, corona in UK, corona in Italy and so on are operated as the topic of tweets. Tweets are downloaded with using Tweepy. Effects of corona on distinct countries are obtained through sentiment analysis on tweets and a comparison between real covid data is compared.
